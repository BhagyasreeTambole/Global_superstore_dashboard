The E-Commerce Data Analytics project is to develop strategies of sales performances and consumers' behaviors that could be adopted for improving sales. This project will include the steps of data pre-processing, data modeling, and data visualization in creating an interactive dashboard for decision-makers. Data Preparation: Ensured accurate data primarily through data correction of any error that may have been obtained and value misses. Modeling and Visualizations: Used Power Query, pivot tables, and charts in Excel in various data analytic procedures in order to offer the solutions. Interactive Dashboards: Utilized advanced interactive visualizations in Power BI and Tableau and presented the same information in simple forms for the client. Result: Focus on Customer Satisfaction and improved timing of shipment are strategies that will position the company to achieve stable sales growth.
